The emergence of heavier-than-air flight in the decade before the outbreak of the First World War presaged the change in the character of warfare that appeared between 1914 and 1918. Yet, as John H. Morrow Jr. wrote:
Military aviation did not determine the outcome of World War I, but the airplane did establish its very real significance in support of the army on the battlefield.
This view raises a fundamental question about the evolution and effect air power had on the conduct of the First World War: did the First World War do more for air power than air power did for the conflict? This question must fit into the broader historical discussion of whether armies in the First World War learned from their experiences. Indeed, if historians accept that the armies and navies of the First World War went through some form of a "learning curve", or process, then they had to cope with the changes forced on them by the emergence of air power and the impact that it had on the character of war. However, in many respects, aviation was an emerging technology, and all thinking on its application was, in 1914, experimental. Nevertheless, by the end of 1914, three of the four principal air power roles identifiable in modern doctrine can be recognised. These were control of the air, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and attack. The final role of air mobility in a nascent form would eventually appear by 1918. As such, this article examines the role of air power in the First World War covering the critical areas of control of the air, tactical air power, strategic bombing, and naval and maritime air power.
The term tactical air power refers to the application of military aviation in support of ground forces through the provision of ISR – observation and reconnaissance – and offensive action against ground targets. The use of such a capability was applicable to both offensive and defensive operations during the First World War. Before 1914, it was recognised that air assets could provide a distinct advantage on the battlefield. The use of lighter-than-air platforms in the 19th century laid the foundation for the use of air power in the observation and reconnaissance roles, while the emergence of heavier-than-air flight added the further advantage of ever increasing speed. The pre-war militaries of Europe and even less powerful European countries did not ignore the potential benefits provided by air power. For example, air assets were used to limited effect during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 and the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. While there is some evidence that the pre-war officer classes of European militaries had reservations about the use of air power, the establishment of air arms by the major powers to support their armies illustrates that, in a limited sense, aviation was viewed as a valuable addition to existing capabilities.
While 1914 saw some limited strategic raiding by the French and Germans, it was on the battlefield that air power's impact was best illustrated, specifically, at the battles of Mons, the Marne, and Tannenberg. In 1914, air power, with varying degrees of success, provided intelligence via reconnaissance and observation, which provided situational awareness to ground commanders. In the period leading up to Tannenberg, German Zeppelins were used for strategic reconnaissance while at Mons, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), effectively the world's first expeditionary air force when it deployed to France in mid-August 1914, helped report on the German troop movements as well as the activities of the French Fifth Army. In the subsequent retreat that ended at the Battle of the Marne, the RFC continued to provide intelligence to Field Marshal Sir John French's (1852–1925) British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on enemy troop movements. While the effectiveness of these actions are debated, its importance lies in French's first dispatch, published on 8 September 1914, in which he praised the RFC. This "buy-in" from senior leaders became increasingly crucial for all militaries as air power advocates sought to develop their respective arms.
At the Battle of the Marne, both French and German aviators provided prompt if uneven support. For example, General Joseph Joffre (1852–1931) praised French aerial observation on 10 September 1914 and was impressed enough to appoint Commandant Joseph Edouard Barès (1872–1954) as his head of aviation at the Grand Quartier Général (GQG). This was because Joffre recognised that he needed "someone with initiative to organize [the Aeronautique Militaire] at the front". Similarly, German aviators "detected Joffre's counteroffensive" at the Marne. While air power provided useful situational awareness that helped shape commanders' understanding of the battlespace, the application of this capability to the conduct of operations depended on the attitude of the end users. Some French and British officers were reluctant to use aeroplanes, while organisational issues caused challenges for the Germans. Nevertheless, as 1914 ended, ground commanders became increasingly supportive of the intelligence generated from the air. This was reinforced by developments in aerial photography that continued to evolve in 1915. Additionally, the use of offensive air power to support ground forces also began to appear around the time of the First Battle of Ypres.
As operations moved into 1915, air power became increasingly crucial to the planning and conduct of the land battles. In addition to aeroplanes, balloons were an important platform for observation by all sides because their static nature meant that observers became familiar with the terrain they surveyed and focused on the process of artillery support. They were, however, limited by the field of vision and became a prime target for fighters trying to restrict the situational awareness of the enemy. On the Eastern Front, reconnaissance and observation were necessary, though the geographic scope of the theatre made it a challenging process. Nevertheless, Russia created the so-called Eskadra Vosdushykh Korablei (EVK or Squadron of Flying Ships) equipped with Igor Sikorsky's (1889–1972) Il'ya Muromets aeroplane. Although designed for transportation, the Il'ya Muromets was used as bombing and reconnaissance platforms. In the latter role, they were used to undertake long-range reconnaissance operations to track German troop movements.
However, it was on the Western Front that crucial developments occurred. Developments in photography by both the French and British eventually led to the provision of image-based assessments that, through the production of photo mosaics, mapped artillery positions and allowed pre-planned registration of guns. Such techniques were put into effect during the planning and execution of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle; the "First Imagery-Planned Battle". These developments did not solve all problems but indicated the influence that air power could have on land battles. For the British, tactical support via observation was enhanced by the development of the clock code system of directing artillery fire, which mapped and corrected the fall of shot. As a critical element in the development of effective artillery fire support, air power contributed to an "indirect-fire revolution required radical reorganization of the contending armies". Air arms "reorganization" led to the emergence of "air defence" and "air combat" to stop the enemy from observing their operations. In due course, this, in part, led to the emergence of "separate air services". The Germans also recognised the importance of observation, and by 1917, German doctrine reflected that in "positional warfare aerial spotting takes on a decisive role within the whole context of the battle plan".
"Contact patrols" further enabled the provision of timely intelligence. In the RFC, contact patrols appeared as a response to the problem identified in 1915 of maintaining contact with forward troops, as communications could be easily cut due to artillery fire. Thus, it was necessary to find a means to allow rear headquarters to communicate with forward troops and vice versa; aeroplanes offered that capability. Derived from operational experience as well as learning from French experiences, contact patrols became the principal method of communication at the forward edge of the battlefield. However, contact patrols, as undertaken by "corps" squadrons, were not without challenges, namely communication between infantry and aeroplanes. German aviators highlighted similar issues, and one of the key problems was that ground forces were often reluctant to identify their positions to aeroplanes for fear that it would identify them to opposing artillery. Improvements emerged and as the war continued, specialised contact patrol methods were developed to work with cavalry and tanks. These developments also became codified in British army doctrine, notably SS135 – The Division in the Attack – 1918. The German army also codified its experience with contact patrols in its 1917 manual on Der Infanterieflieger und der Infanterieballon (Infantry Airplane and Infantry Balloon).
